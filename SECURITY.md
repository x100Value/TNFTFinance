# SECURITY.md

## Reporting
If you find a vulnerability, do not publish it publicly.
Send details privately to project maintainers.

## Mandatory Rules
- Protocol safety first.
- Rounding favors protocol safety.
- No mainnet without tests, invariants, audit.
- Oracle must be fail-closed.
- No unlimited approvals by default.
- Multisig + timelock for privileged actions.
